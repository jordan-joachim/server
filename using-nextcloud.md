# Typical uses of nextcloud in our family

We are using nextcloud to synchronize many things between mobiles, computers and laptops.

First and foremost is file sharing, makes much sense especially when you have an offline password manager like keepass2.

The next is to share calendar and contacts. I also plan to use it to share tasks, i find it very useful to be able to add calendar entries and tasks into the calendar and task lists of other members

Finally, i started to use bookmarks to share browser bookmarks between devices
